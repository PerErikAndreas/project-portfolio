Project Portfolio

The assignment was to create your own portfolio from a sketch in figma,using css and html.
The task was also to make it accessible for screenreaders and for different browsers (chrome, edge and firefox)

The problem
I approached this task by reading up on how to build accessible sites then a started coding. I figured the site should be best built using FlexBox so i went that way. I really tried to use the HTML semantics and aria tags in the right way but I found it pretty hard. I think there may be more divs then needed and also parts with repeated code in the css. But overall im proud doing this in this short time.
